CacheSim
========
CacheSim is a simple cache simulator, written in Python, that implements an
N-way set-associative LRU cache, used for exploring the cache hit and miss
rates when feeding in address traces from two programs, generated by the
pinatrace Pin tool. These accesses are interleaved to simulate context
switching between different threads.

This program is compatible with Python 2.6.                                    

To generate an input file, run:
    pin -t /path/to/pinatrace.so -- <executable>

Good sample programs to try are those involving interesting data reference     
patterns, such as image processing programs or those working with matrices.    
Trace files around a gigabyte in size are relatively quick to work with.
